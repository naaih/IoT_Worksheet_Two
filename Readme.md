# **Worksheet Two - Challenge Two**

A simple communication protocol that transmits data between 2 BBC Micro:bit devices, using GPIOs.

## How it works:
1. When the button **A** is pressed on the microbit 1, a dot is sent to the mircobit 2 using the pin 
2. If the button **B** is pressed on the microbit 1, a dash is sent to the mircobit 2 using the pin 1
